## Project memory

This repo uses a scoped memory system at `.claude-memory/`.

Memory context is loaded automatically before you start work via a `UserPromptSubmit` hook. Do not re-read memory files unless you need a page that was not loaded.

### Mid-task retrieval

If you need a memory page that was not loaded at session start, read it directly using the Read tool under `.claude-memory/wiki/`. Do not ask the user for it.

### Explicit memory instructions

If the user says "remember that X" or "note that X":
- Append a `user_instruction` event to `.claude-memory/raw/events/` with `importance: high`.
- Do not wait for confirmation.

### Do not

- Rewrite canonical wiki pages directly unless explicitly asked.
- Ask the user to run memory commands.
- Skip appending a raw event after any session where files were changed (the post-write hook handles this; if you notice it was skipped, do it manually).
